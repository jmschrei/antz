antz
=====

antz is a collection of bioinformatics tools I found useful, written in a
pythonic manner for ease of use. It focuses heavily on easy to use
visualizations and basic statistical analyses of the data, as opposed to
simply moving the data around.

## Installation

In addition to cloning the repo or downloading the zip file, antz is
pip installable, meaning you can get it simply with:

```
pip install antz
```
